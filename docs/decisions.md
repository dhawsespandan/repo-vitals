# Decision log

A running ADR log, seeded with the locked decisions D1–D17 from the
implementation plan (`plan/repo_vitals_implementation_plan.md` §1). Those are
not restated here — read them there. This file records **refinements made
during the build**: choices the plan left open, places where an implementation
detail turned out to matter, and ideas deliberately *not* built (§12 says to
note them here rather than build them).

Append, never rewrite. One entry per decision, newest phase last.

## Phase 1 — Foundations

### 1.1 `AbstractBaseUser`, not a bare model

**Context.** §5.1 specifies `app_users` with no password column — identity is
GitHub's.

**Decision.** `accounts.User` still subclasses Django's `AbstractBaseUser`.

**Why.** Django's session machinery calls `get_session_auth_hash()`, which
`AbstractBaseUser` provides and which is derived from the password field. A
model without it would need that plumbing reimplemented by hand for no gain.
The inherited `password` column exists and is always set unusable; no code path
can set one. `AbstractBaseUser.last_login` is re-declared onto the spec's
`last_login_at` column so there is exactly one "last sign-in" field rather than
a Django one and a spec one side by side.

`django.contrib.admin` is deliberately **not** installed: it would need a
password-based login path into a product that has none.

### 1.2 UUID primary keys default in Python, not in Postgres

**Context.** §5.1 says PKs are `UUID gen_random_uuid()`.

**Decision.** `models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)`.

**Why.** Identical semantics for every write that goes through the ORM, with
no dependency on a database function. Research tooling that bulk-loads rows
outside the ORM (Phase 11) can still call `gen_random_uuid()` server-side.

### 1.3 The OAuth routes are wired explicitly, not by `include(allauth.urls)`

**Decision.** `config/urls.py` mounts allauth's `OAuth2LoginView` and
`OAuth2CallbackView` at the two paths §5.5 specifies, and includes nothing
else from allauth.

**Why.** Two reasons. The callback path §5.5 specifies is
`/api/auth/github/callback/`, whereas `include(allauth.urls)` produces
`.../login/callback/`. And allauth's URLconf brings a signup form, password
reset, email management and logout pages — a whole HTML surface for flows this
product does not have. Wiring the two views by hand keeps the URLconf equal to
the API surface.

The url **names** (`github_login`, `github_callback`) must not change: allauth
reverses `github_callback` to build the `redirect_uri` it sends to GitHub.

### 1.4 Granted OAuth scopes are captured off the token response

**Decision.** `RepoVitalsGitHubOAuth2Adapter.parse_token()` carries GitHub's
`scope` string through to the login signal on the in-memory token object.

**Why.** §5.1 stores `token_scopes`, but allauth's base `parse_token()` keeps
only the access token and drops the rest of the response. GitHub can grant
fewer scopes than were requested; recording what we actually hold is what lets
a later phase say "this repository needs the `repo` scope, which you did not
grant" instead of returning a mystifying 404.

### 1.5 Log redaction is a filter, not a convention

**Decision.** `apps/common/logging.py::RedactSecretsFilter` is attached to the
console handler and scrubs GitHub token shapes and Fernet ciphertext from every
record.

**Why.** §11 lists "no token substring in logs" as a Phase 1 verification.
Relying on every future call site to remember is not a control. The filter is,
and it is covered by `tests/test_log_redaction.py`.

### 1.6 The session endpoint returns 200 for anonymous visitors

**Decision.** `GET /api/auth/session/` answers `{"authenticated": false,
"user": null}` with HTTP 200 rather than 401.

**Why.** The SPA calls it once on every cold load to decide which screen to
render. "Nobody is signed in" is a normal answer to that question, not a
failure; modelling it as a 401 makes every signed-out page load look like an
error in the console and in the client's error handling.

### 1.7 Back-navigation guard: a routing rule, not a `popstate` listener

**Context.** Phase 1 requires that back-navigation can never log a user out or
expose the login screen.

**Decision.** The `/login` route refuses to render for an authenticated user.
It redirects to the last in-app path, carrying a router-state flag that opens
the sign-out confirmation. The login screen renders only once the session is
actually gone — which happens only on explicit confirm.

**Why.** The obvious implementation — listen for `popstate`, then
`history.pushState` back — leaves React Router's idea of the location out of
step with the address bar, and still lets the login screen paint for a frame.
Making it a rule about what a route may render covers the back gesture, a typed
URL and a restored tab with one mechanism, and it is testable without
simulating browser history.

### 1.8 Tailwind v3 with `tailwind.config.js`

**Decision.** Tailwind 3.4 rather than v4's CSS-first configuration.

**Why.** §3's file layout names `tailwind.config.js`. The look comes from
`frontend/src/styles/industry.css` — lifted verbatim from the approved
wireframe, which is the binding visual spec — and Tailwind is only a utility
layer over it, so there is nothing to gain from the newer configuration model
and a plan-layout mismatch to lose. `industry.css` is imported *after*
`index.css` in `main.tsx` so its rules win over Tailwind's preflight reset;
an `@import` inside `index.css` cannot achieve that, because CSS requires
imports to precede other rules.

### 1.9 fastembed is installed from Phase 1, unused until Phase 8

**Decision.** `fastembed` is in `requirements.txt` now.

**Why.** The memory smoke test (§10 Phase 1) exists to answer a real 512 MB
feasibility question in week one, and it can only answer it by loading the
model the production worker will actually hold. `manage.py smoke_memory
--skip-embedding` degrades gracefully when it is absent.

### 1.10 Not built (§12 watch-list)

Noted, deliberately absent, do not add without an explicit decision here:
CORS middleware and JWTs (the Vercel rewrite makes every call same-site);
`django.contrib.admin`; a TTL cache in front of any registry; any outbound
HTTP client other than the one `common/http.py` will introduce in Phase 2.

### 1.12 Repo registration is restricted to the user's own namespace or public repos — binding for Phase 2

**Context.** GitHub OAuth Apps grant the `repo` scope as all-or-nothing: the
resulting token can technically reach every repository the account can see,
including ones owned by an organization the user belongs to (e.g. an
employer). There is no OAuth scope that filters by ownership, and per-repo
consent only exists on GitHub's separate "GitHub App" mechanism, which §12
already defers as future work.

**Decision.** Phase 2's pre-scan validation (§5.6) gets one additional
ordered check, run alongside the existing four: reject registration if the
repository is private **and** its owner is not the authenticated user's own
account (`repository.owner.login != user.github_username`). Public repos and
repos in the user's personal namespace pass; anything owned by an
organization — regardless of whether the token can technically reach it — is
rejected before any scan work or GitHub quota is spent on it.

**Why.** The token's technical reach can't be narrowed at the GitHub layer,
but Repo Vitals' own behavior can be. This guarantees the application itself
never calls the API for, stores data about, or scans an organization-owned
repository, which is what actually matters for a user whose account is also a
member of an employer's org. It costs one extra condition in a validation
function Phase 2 already needs to write — not a separate effort.

**Operationally verified today:** during OAuth authorization, GitHub shows a
separate "Organization access" row per org the account belongs to, each with
its own Grant/Request button, independent of the main "Authorize" action.
Declining to click an org's Request button means GitHub never notifies that
org or its admins — confirmed live against two real orgs on the developer's
account. This Phase 2 rule is the code-level backstop for the case where an
org's OAuth restrictions are off and access would otherwise be silent.

### 1.13 Memory smoke test result

`manage.py smoke_memory` records worker RSS at four points plus the peak.
**Record the production number here after the first Render deploy** — the
figure that matters is the one measured on the 512 MB instance, not on a
developer machine.

| Environment | Date | Baseline | After request | After thread | After embedding | Peak |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Render free (prod) | _pending first deploy_ | | | | | |
| Dev machine | _pending_ | | | | | |
